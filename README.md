# Fill Form App

00SR - Develop Native Application Without A Database

In this project I have created an interaction by a pretended CRM web app, where we can fill a Lead form. This app must not use databases as part of the competency tasks. For this I used a json file to store the data inserted.

This data can be seen at another page called consult Leads and also be downloaded as a .csv file.

The project uses Ruby on Rails with Tailwind for frontend.
>Ruby version: 3.1.6
>Rails version: 7.1.5

**Configuration**
Since thereâ€™s no database, we will create a plain Ruby model using ActiveModel and handle JSON file storage.

**How to run the test suite**
